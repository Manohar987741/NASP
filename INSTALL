 The Northern Arizona SNP Pipeline (NASP)
==========================================


 INSTALLATION:
---------------
NASP itself is a set of python scripts with no special requirements for use.
No "Makefile" or "setup.py" script is required, as no special steps need be
taken.  All of the included '.py' files should reside in the same folder.
The following files should then have their execute flag set and reside in, or
be symbolically linked to, a folder within the user's PATH:

 * nasp.py
 * vcf_to_matrix.py
 * format_fasta.py
 * convert_external_genome.py
 * find_duplicates.py

The three most common installation scenarios are:

Single user:
  If you do not have administrator access to the system you wish to install on,
  or are installing to a system that is not Unix-based (untested), you will
  probably want to copy the files listed above to your home bin (usually ~/bin)
  and make sure your PATH includes that.  A common set of commands to do this
  would be:

    mkdir ~/nasp_pipeline
    mv nasp.tar.gz ~/nasp_pipeline
    cd ~/nasp_pipeline
    tar xzvf nasp.tar.gz
    mkdir ~/bin
    cd ~/bin
    ln -s ../nasp_pipeline/*.py ./
    echo 'PATH="$HOME/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.profile

Multi-user:
  If you have administrator access to the system you wish to install on, and
  wish to install NASP for all users, you would usually place the python files
  in a system-wide bin folder located E.G. in /opt or /usr/local.  A common set
  of commands to do this would be:

    mkdir /usr/local/src/nasp_pipeline
    mv nasp.tar.gz /usr/local/src/nasp_pipeline/
    cd /usr/local/src/nasp_pipeline/
    tar xzvf nasp.tar.gz
    cd /usr/local/bin
    ln -s ../src/nasp_pipeline/*.py ./

Using the "module load" system:
  If you have configured a module system on your high-performance compute
  cluster, you can create a NASP module for your users to load.  Refer to your
  operating system documentation for specifics.  Do not forget to include the
  software dependencies, as described below.
